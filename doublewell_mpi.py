import usample.usample
import numpy as np
import emcee

#
# Sample a 2D distribution of the sum of two Gaussians
#
# Define the log probability function:
#


def log_prob_fn(p ):

    x=p[0]
    y=p[1]

    # Two Gaussian distributions, centered on +/- 1
    lpf = np.log( np.exp(-16*(x-1)**2) + np.exp(-16*(x+1)**2  ))
    # And an independent Gaussian in another direction
    lpf -= 0.5*y*y


    return lpf

#
# Now create the umbrella sampler object
us = usample.UmbrellaSampler( log_prob_fn  , mpi=True, debug=True,  burn_acor=20 )

#
# Build umbrellas along a line between two points: the two peaks of the distribution.
# This line is a 1D "CV" or Collective Variable, embedded in the higher dimensions.
# The CV runs from (-1,0) to (1,0)
cvfn = ["line", [np.array([-1.0,0]), np.array([1.0,0])] ]

# In the cv coordinates the start of the line is "0" and the end is "1".
# We define the centers of the biasing distribution in the CVs.
# Here we define the centers of the four umbrellas:
centers = np.linspace( 0 , 1 , 4 )

# We may also make use of sampling using different temperatures within a window.
# Lets try sampling at a temperature of 1 and 5.
temps = [1,5]

# Note that this gives a total of 4x2=8 umbrellas overall.
# We are umbrella sampling in two directions:
#   - perpendicular to the 1D line defined in "cvfn" (4 umbrellas)
#   - the temperature  (2 umbrellas)
# Feel free to experiment with the parameters.
#

#
# Other than a "line" in cvfn, we may also use "grid" to place umbrellas in a checkerboard.
# The usage looks like this:
##cvfn = ["grid", [np.array([-1.0,0]), np.array([1.0,0]), np.array([-1.0,1.0])] ]
##centers = [ [ii,jj] for ii in np.linspace( 0 , 1 , 3 ) for jj in np.linspace( 0 , 1 , 5 ) ]
# Where "grid" takes a list of three points [a,b,c] defining the 2D plane and the boundaries where
# the first grid line is (a->b) and the second is (a->c). These two lines need not be perpendicular.
#

#
# Once we have defined the umbrellas as above, we run using the following routine:
us.add_umbrellas( temperatures=temps, centers=centers, cvfn=cvfn , numwalkers=8 , ic=np.array([0,0]) , sampler=emcee.EnsembleSampler )

#
# Then run for 10000 steps in each window.
# Output stats every [freq] steps
# Try to replica exchange [repex]-many walkers every [freq] steps
#

pos,weights,prob = us.run(10000 , freq=100, repex=10    )

#
# We save the output
#

if (us.is_master() ):

    x = np.append( pos , weights , axis=1 )
    x = np.append( x , prob , axis=1 )

    np.savetxt(  'results_doublewell_mpi.txt' , x )
